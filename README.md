# Logi Heating Scheduler

Heating Scheduler for Homey v2

In Norse mythology, Logi, Loge (Old Norse "fire") or Hálogi ("High Flame") is a fire giant, god and personification of fire. He is son of giant Fornjótr and brother of Ægir (sea giant) and Kári (god of the wind). Logi married fire giantess Glöð and she bore him two beautiful daughters—Eisa and Eimyrja.

This in fact is a Homey App to schedule changes to thermostats in your home. It's certainly not the only one, and probably not the best, but I figured I'd share it anyway.

So, here's the thing, this app is experimental and beta. That means it may not work for you, or be suitable for your needs.
